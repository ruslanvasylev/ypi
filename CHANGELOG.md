## [Unreleased]

### Added
- A canonical TypeScript recursion runtime core now owns child planning, guardrails, routing, resources, environment projection, bounded spawning, result classification, and cleanup for both native and CLI calls. The Pi tool and Node CLI are thin adapters; the incumbent native and shell engines remain available through `YPI_LEGACY_IMPL=1` during convergence.
- An executable native/CLI runtime contract freezes shared behavior and names any intentional divergence; the initial stabilized contract passes with no known deterministic divergences.

### Changed
- Bare `ypi` now explicitly preserves Pi-native root model selection: root provider/model/thinking come from Pi settings (`defaultProvider`, `defaultModel`, `defaultThinkingLevel`), `/model`, or CLI flags, while children inherit the active root route by default. Recursive child routing can now be lowered by depth with `RLM_CHILD_MODELS`, `RLM_CHILD_PROVIDERS`, and `RLM_CHILD_THINKING_LEVELS` without narrowing the root default, toolset, timeout, or call-limit behavior.
- Agent-facing guidance now describes ypi as an RLM-inspired recursive coding-agent runtime rather than an Algorithm 1 reproduction, distinguishes the root prompt from delegated prompt files, and states which configured guardrails actually enforce bounds.

### Fixed
- Native child stdout and stderr are retained through bounded streaming capture instead of unbounded string concatenation, preventing large Pi JSON streams from reaching V8's maximum string length before final tool-output truncation.
- CLI `rlm_query --async` closes the background worker's inherited stdio so documented `JOB=$(rlm_query --async ...)` capture returns immediately; sentinels now record the eventual child exit code and cleanup runs even when the child fails.
- Native recursion depth parsing now rejects integer prefixes such as `0junk` and values outside the safe-integer range instead of silently accepting the numeric prefix.
- Native and CLI no-jj children now share the same built-in mutator exclusion policy without a global tool allowlist, and extension-isolated children keep the standalone ypi system prompt through both adapters.
- Budget enforcement now fails closed through both adapters when `RLM_JSON=0`, because unmeasured plain output cannot update the shared cost ledger.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-06-22

### Changed
- **npm keywords aligned with the pi package gallery.** The gallery at `pi.dev/packages` discovers packages by the `pi-package` keyword (already present on both); this adds `pi-coding-agent` to both packages and `pi-extension` to `ypi` to match the convention used by featured pi packages and improve in-ecosystem search ranking.
- `pi-recursive` `repository.url` normalized to `git+https://…` (was emitting an npm publish warning).

### Verified
- Real `pi install npm:pi-recursive` from the registry, in an isolated `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`: installs, writes `settings.json`, and registers the native `rlm_query` tool (`__YPI_NATIVE_TOOL_REGISTERED__`).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- **`pi-recursive` package**: the pure Pi extension (the `pi.extensions` surface, no `bin`) is now published as its own companion package — `pi install npm:pi-recursive`. `ypi` remains the CLI wrapper. Both are built from one canonical source: `pi-recursive` is staged from the root `extensions/` + `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` by `scripts/build-pi-recursive` (an explicit build step, not an npm lifecycle hook), and `tests/test_pi_recursive_pack.sh` proves the packed extension installs and registers the native tool.
- **Extension-first architecture**: `extensions/recursive.ts` is now the canonical Pi extension; the `ypi` launcher and shell `rlm_query` are convenience layers around it. Split into modules under `extensions/ypi/` (`runtime`, `env`, `guardrails`, `prompt`, `status`, `native-tool`).
- **Native `rlm_query` Pi tool**: recursion works from a bare `pi -e ./extensions/recursive.ts` (or npm extension install) with no `ypi` launcher, shell helper, or jj. Verified against Pi 0.79.4.
- **`pure-extension/` proof + parity harness** (`test.sh`, `compare.sh`, `DIFFERENCES.md`) and a native-tool unit harness (`tests/test_native_tool.sh`).
- **Self-validating provider env allowlist** (`tests/test_provider_allowlist.sh`): enforces native/shell parity and completeness, deriving the required credential set from pi-mono's `getApiKeyEnvVars()` (suffix-agnostic) so the allowlist cannot silently drift or go blind to names like `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` / `HF_TOKEN`.
- **`.gitleaks.toml`**: extends the default ruleset with a narrow allowlist for Cloudflare provider env-var *names* (identifiers, not secrets).
- Packed-consumer smoke (`tests/test_consumer_pack.sh`) asserts the tarball ships `rlm_cleanup` and installs it as an executable.

### Changed
- **Shell helper is opt-in** via `YPI_SHELL_HELPER=1` (set by the `ypi` wrapper). A bare `pi -e` / npm extension install defaults to the native tool only — no shell helper on `PATH`, no shell source folded into the prompt.
- Provider env allowlist extended to cover additional Pi 0.79.4 credentials (Google Cloud, Ollama, Portkey, MiniMax CN, AWS container/web-identity, Azure API version, Cloudflare gateway routing).
- `package.json`: `typebox` moved to runtime `dependencies`; `rlm_cleanup` added to `bin` and `files`.

### Fixed
- **`RLM_MAX_CALLS` off-by-one**: `RLM_MAX_CALLS=N` now permits exactly N calls (was N−1) in both the native tool and shell `rlm_query`.
- **Trace-ID path traversal**: `RLM_TRACE_ID` is sanitized before use in session/temp filenames and async job IDs.
- **Stale timeout budget**: `RLM_START_TIME` is anchored when each depth-0 recursion tree begins instead of frozen at extension load, so a long-running root Pi no longer falsely times out.
- **Async `--notify`**: peer-inbox lines are JSON-encoded with `python3` (valid even with quotes/newlines in child output); async temp files honor `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}` instead of hardcoded `/tmp`.
- **`check-upstream --dry-run`**: now runs the test suite even when the pinned version is already known-good (previously skipped tests via an early exit).
- **Provider credential forwarding**: recursive children now inherit `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` (github-copilot) and `HF_TOKEN` (huggingface), which were dropped by the child-env allowlist — env-var-only-authed parents could not authenticate their children for those providers.
- **Recursion depth config fails closed**: a non-integer `RLM_DEPTH`/`RLM_MAX_DEPTH` now errors instead of silently bypassing the depth limiter (native and shell).
- Collapsed a dead `--no-extensions` if/else branch in the shell `rlm_query` (both arms were identical).

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-23

### Fixed
- **macOS mktemp compatibility**: BSD `mktemp` does not allow characters after the `XXXXXX` template suffix — moved `XXXXXX` to end of all templates and use `${TMPDIR:-/tmp}` for portable temp directory resolution
- **Bash 3.2 unbound variable crash**: empty array expansion under `set -u` fails on macOS default bash — build argv incrementally with length checks in `ypi` launcher

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Notify-done extension** (`contrib/extensions/notify-done.ts`): background task completion notifications via sentinel files — injects messages into conversation when tasks finish, no polling needed
- **LSP extension** (`contrib/extensions/lsp/`): Language Server Protocol integration for code intelligence (diagnostics, references, definitions, rename, hover, symbols)
- **Persist-system-prompt extension** (`contrib/extensions/persist-system-prompt.ts`): saves effective system prompt to session files for debugging and reproducibility
- **Auto-title extension** (`contrib/extensions/auto-title.ts`): automatic session title generation
- **Cachebro extension** (`contrib/extensions/cachebro.ts`): intelligent file caching with diff-aware invalidation and token estimation
- **Context window awareness**: SYSTEM_PROMPT.md now teaches agents about finite context budgets and how to manage them
- Tests for notify-done and persist-system-prompt extensions

### Changed
- **AGENTS.md**: added sentinel/notify-done workflow pattern, background task instructions
- **SYSTEM_PROMPT.md**: context window awareness guidance
- **contrib/README.md**: updated with new extensions documentation

### Fixed
- Notify-done extension: block broadcast sentinels, use `steer` for busy agents, `display: true` for visibility

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **`rlm_sessions` command**: inspect, read, and search session logs from sibling and parent agents in the recursive tree (`rlm_sessions --trace`, `rlm_sessions read <file>`, `rlm_sessions grep <pattern>`)
- **Symbolic prompt access** (`RLM_PROMPT_FILE`): agents can grep/sed the original prompt as a file instead of copying tokens from context memory
- **Contrib extensions**: `colgrep.ts` (semantic code search via ColBERT), `dirpack.ts` (repository index), `treemap.ts` (visual tree maps) — opt-in extensions in `contrib/extensions/`
- **Encryption workflow**: `scripts/encrypt-prose` and `scripts/decrypt-prose` for sops/age encryption of private execution state before pushing
- **`.sops.yaml`**: age encryption rules for `.prose/runs/`, `.prose/agents/`, `experiments/`, `private/`
- **`.githooks/pre-commit`**: safety net blocking unencrypted private files on direct git push
- **OpenProse programs**: `release.prose`, `land.prose`, `incorporate-insight.prose`, `recursive-development.prose`, `self-experiment.prose`, `check-upstream.prose`
- **Experiment infrastructure**: `experiments/` directory with pipe-vs-filename, session-sharing, and tree-awareness experiments with results
- E2E tests: expanded coverage (+90 lines), gemini-flash as default e2e model
- Guardrail tests: `rlm_sessions` tests (G48-G51), session sharing toggle
- Unit tests: `RLM_PROMPT_FILE` tests (T14d)

### Changed
- **SYSTEM_PROMPT.md**: added symbolic access principle (SECTION 2), refined depth awareness guidance
- **AGENTS.md**: expanded with experiment workflow (tmux rules), self-experimentation, session history reading, OpenProse program references
- **README.md**: updated feature list and project description
- Removed hardcoded provider/model defaults from `rlm_query` — inherits from environment only

### Fixed
- Kill orphan `rlm_parse_json` processes after timeout in E2E tests
- Contrib extension GitHub links (dirpack, colgrep) now point to correct URLs

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **ypi status extension** (`extensions/ypi.ts`): shows `ypi ∞ depth 0/3` in footer status bar and sets terminal title to "ypi" — visual indicator that this is recursive Pi, not vanilla
- **CI workflows**: GitHub Actions for push/PR testing and upstream Pi compatibility checks every 6 hours
- **`scripts/check-upstream`**: local script to test ypi against latest Pi version — no GitHub required
- **`tests/test_extensions.sh`**: verifies `.ts` extensions load cleanly with installed Pi
- **`.pi-version`**: tracks last known-good Pi version for compatibility monitoring
- `make test-extensions` and `make check-upstream` targets

### Changed
- Removed hardcoded hashline extension from `ypi` launcher — user's own Pi extensions (installed at `~/.pi/agent/extensions/`) are discovered automatically by Pi
- Removed `RLM_HASHLINE` environment variable (no longer needed)

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-13

### Fixed
- Skip bundled `hashline.ts` extension when the global install (`~/.pi/agent/extensions/hashline.ts`) exists, fixing "Tool read/edit conflicts" error

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- **Cost tracking**: children default to `--mode json`, parsed by `rlm_parse_json` for structured cost/token data
- **Budget enforcement**: `RLM_BUDGET=0.50` caps dollar spend for entire recursive tree
- **`rlm_cost` command**: agent can query cumulative spend at any time (`rlm_cost` or `rlm_cost --json`)
- **`rlm_parse_json`**: streams text to stdout, captures cost via fd 3 to shared cost file
- System prompt updated with cost awareness (SECTION 4 teaches `rlm_cost`)
- `rlm_query` source embedded in system prompt (SECTION 6) so agents understand their own infrastructure

### Changed
- **Uniform children**: removed separate leaf path — all depths get full tools, extensions, sessions, jj workspaces
- **Extensions on by default** at all depths (`RLM_EXTENSIONS=1`)
- **`RLM_CHILD_EXTENSIONS`**: per-instance extension override for depth > 0
- Recursion limited by removing `rlm_query` from PATH at max depth (not `--no-tools`)
- `RLM_JSON=0` opt-out for plain text mode (disables cost tracking)

### Removed
- Separate leaf code path (`--no-tools`, `--no-extensions`, `--no-session` at max depth)
- sops/age/gitleaks references from README and install.sh (internal only)

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-12

Initial release.

### Added
- `ypi` launcher — starts Pi as a recursive coding agent
- `rlm_query` — bash recursive sub-call function (analog of Python RLM's `llm_query()`)
- `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` — teaches the LLM to use recursion + bash for divide-and-conquer
- Guardrails: timeout (`RLM_TIMEOUT`), call limits (`RLM_MAX_CALLS`), depth limits (`RLM_MAX_DEPTH`)
- Model routing: `RLM_CHILD_MODEL` / `RLM_CHILD_PROVIDER` for cheaper sub-calls
- jj workspace isolation for recursive children (`RLM_JJ`)
- Session forking and trace logging (`PI_TRACE_FILE`, `RLM_TRACE_ID`)
- Pi extensions support (`RLM_EXTENSIONS`, `RLM_CHILD_EXTENSIONS`)
- `install.sh` for curl-pipe-bash installation
- npm package with `ypi` and `rlm_query` as global CLI commands
