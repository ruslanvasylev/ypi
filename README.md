# ypi

`ypi` is a source-distributed recursive coding agent built on
[Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi). It adds one canonical TypeScript
recursion runtime with two adapters:

- `extensions/recursive.ts` registers a native Pi tool named `rlm_query`.
- `rlm_query` is a shell adapter for pipelines, explicit context, and
  background jobs.

The `ypi` launcher loads the extension, the repository prompt, and the bounded
delegation skill. Review children are read-only by default. A root agent can
charter up to three bounded implementers on disjoint declared path scopes in an
existing clean Git checkout.

## Lineage

This project is a hard fork of [rawwerks/ypi](https://github.com/rawwerks/ypi).
Its recursive delegation model is inspired by the Recursive Language Models
line of work. The name applies the Y-combinator idea of recursion to Pi.

## Source Setup

Requirements:

- Git
- Bun
- Node.js 22.19 or newer
- provider credentials supported by Pi

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ruslanvasylev/ypi.git
cd ypi
git submodule update --init --depth 1
bun install --frozen-lockfile
make doctor
make test-extensions
```

This repository is the distribution boundary. It is private in
`package.json`; there is no registry or curl installation path.

## Entry Paths

Run the configured wrapper:

```bash
./ypi
./ypi -p "Explain the main execution path in this checkout."
./ypi --provider openai --model gpt-5.5 -p "Review the current branch."
```

Or load only the native extension into the repository-local Pi:

```bash
./node_modules/.bin/pi --no-extensions \
  -e "$PWD/extensions/recursive.ts" \
  -p "Use rlm_query to ask a child what 2 + 2 is."
```

Direct extension use registers the native tool and uses the same runtime core.
It does not enable the shell helper or place repository commands on `PATH`.

The native tool accepts:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `prompt` | Required bounded child charter. |
| `context` | Optional exact context text. |
| `fork` | Copy the current parent session into the child session before execution. |
| `mode` | `review` by default, or root-only `implement`. |
| `scope` | Required for `implement`: literal repository-relative file or directory path prefixes owned by that child. |

The shell adapter reads standard input when `RLM_STDIN` marks it as explicit or
when stdin is non-interactive. A non-empty read wins; otherwise it falls back
to the file named by `CONTEXT`. Its public flags are:

<!-- rlm-query-flags:start -->
| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `--async` | Admit a background review call and return its job paths. |
| `--fork` | Copy the current parent session into the child session. |
<!-- rlm-query-flags:end -->

For example:

```bash
sed -n '1,200p' src/service.ts | ./rlm_query "Review this code for data loss."
./rlm_query --fork "Recheck the current session's main conclusion."
./rlm_query --async "Audit the authentication boundary."
```

An asynchronous admission prints JSON containing `job_id`, `output`,
`sentinel`, and `pid`. The sentinel contains the exit code when the job is
terminal. No repository extension watches those files or wakes a caller; the
caller owns collection and cancellation.

## Recursion Contract

Every non-leaf child runs Pi with the same canonical extension and prompt.
Recursion disappears when the next child would exceed `RLM_MAX_DEPTH`.
`RLM_MAX_CALLS` and the three-child concurrency cap are enforced across the
whole tree by a root-owned, generation-bound coordinator. The optional timeout
is also tree-wide. Root cancellation terminalizes that authority before it
signals registered child process groups; a detached survivor cannot admit or
launch more recursive work after the root dies. Cost and token values are
observational telemetry and never an admission or termination control.

The root keeps its normal Pi tools. Review children exclude mutation and
process-spawning tools. Child extension discovery is canonical-only unless the
caller explicitly accepts ambient extension compatibility. Provider, model,
and thinking level inherit from the active root route unless child-specific or
depth-specific routing is configured.

Use direct inspection for small inputs. Delegate only bounded work that
benefits from a fresh context window. At deeper levels, prefer returning a
concrete result over adding another child call.

## Implementer Lifecycle

Native `rlm_query` may request `mode=implement` only from depth 0. The runtime
admits it only when all of these are true:

- the current directory belongs to an existing, ordinary, clean Git checkout;
- no Git operation is in progress and sparse checkout is disabled;
- a non-empty repository-relative path scope is declared;
- the scope does not overlap any live implementer lease; the tree-wide
  three-generation queue has admitted the child;
- the canonical extension and write-confinement hooks are active.

Each implementer edits a detached ephemeral Git worktree at the shared baseline
and receives only `read,grep,find,ls,edit,write,rlm_query`. It cannot use
`bash`. The user's real checkout remains clean. Writes outside the declared
scope or worktree, through escaping symlinks, inside `.git`, inside submodules,
or to paths ignored by the baseline or final ignore rules are blocked both at
tool execution and again during snapshot verification.

A launch gate records the detached child's stable process identity with the
active root generation before Pi can begin work. This lets recovery distinguish
a live child from a dead lease even if the root process is killed during spawn,
and closes the final authority check-to-exec window. The gate and crash recovery
run through the same Node/TypeScript runtime required by the rest of ypi;
implement mode has no additional Python dependency.

The worktree contains tracked files only. It does not reproduce ignored files
or uninitialized submodule contents. Supply required external material through
`context`, or keep that task in the root.

After the child exits, the parent runtime:

1. verifies the worktree and real checkout baselines, submodules, ignore
   policy, audited write set, and declared scope;
2. stages the entire attempt in a temporary index;
3. creates a commit and a new verified `refs/ypi/attempt-*` reference;
4. stages again immediately before removal and requires the worktree to match
   the verified reference;
5. removes the ephemeral worktree and persisted lease while proving the real
   checkout stayed clean;
6. reports scope, changed paths, baseline, attempt reference, commit, diffstat,
   and `Ephemeral worktree removed: yes`.

Derive disjoint slices from deterministic discovery before issuing parallel
implement calls. Do not mutate the real checkout or integrate any result until
all calls in that batch return. The extension blocks root mutators and unknown
tools that share an assistant tool batch with an implement call. The root must
inspect every result before accepting it:

```bash
git show --stat refs/ypi/attempt-EXAMPLE
git diff HEAD refs/ypi/attempt-EXAMPLE --
git cherry-pick -n refs/ypi/attempt-EXAMPLE
```

For disjoint scopes, applying refs in any order must produce the same tree. A
conflict is evidence of a confinement or partitioning defect; surface it
instead of resolving it automatically.

If snapshot or removal cannot be proven safe, finalization fails loudly. Before
a verified reference exists, the isolated worktree remains the primary copy.
After verification, the reference is authoritative and the worktree is retained
until recovery completes. `./rlm_cleanup --repo PATH` is dry-run by default;
with `--force` it leaves live processes untouched, snapshots each dead lease to
a verified attempt ref, proves the worktree still matches, removes it, and
prunes stale worktree metadata. `--attempt-age` is a reporting threshold only:
attempt refs older than it are listed and preserved. Age never authorizes ref
deletion.

`make test-workspace-crash` covers single-lease interruption points.
`make test-workspace-concurrent-crash` kills children and a parent with multiple
live leases, proving exact work preservation, live-lease isolation, registry
recovery, and a continuously clean real checkout.
`make test-cross-depth-cancellation` proves that root cancellation revokes
admission before terminating independently detached writer and recursive
descendant groups, preserves writable work, and does not signal unrelated
processes.
`make test-implementer-recovery` directly exercises the shared lease schema,
atomic persistence, TypeScript recovery CLI, hostile metadata rejection, and
the user-facing `rlm_cleanup` adapter.

## Runtime Configuration

`config/runtime-env.json` is the machine-readable owner. This table is checked
against the source and must contain exactly the public variables.

<!-- runtime-env:start -->
| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `CONTEXT` | unset | Context file used when no explicit non-empty input is supplied. |
| `PI_TRACE_FILE` | private temporary file | Append-only lifecycle trace destination. |
| `RLM_AMBIENT_EXTENSIONS` | `auto` | Root policy: allow, isolate, or detect conflicting recursion extensions. |
| `RLM_CHILD_DISCOVERY` | enabled | Set to `0` to isolate child skills, templates, themes, context files, and approvals. |
| `RLM_CHILD_EXTENSIONS` | parent policy | Override extension loading for recursive children. |
| `RLM_CHILD_MODEL` | root model | Model for every child depth. |
| `RLM_CHILD_MODELS` | unset | Comma-separated model route for child depths 1, 2, and later. |
| `RLM_CHILD_PROVIDER` | root provider | Provider paired with the all-depth child model. |
| `RLM_CHILD_PROVIDERS` | unset | Comma-separated provider route by child depth. |
| `RLM_CHILD_THINKING_LEVEL` | root level | Thinking level for every child depth. |
| `RLM_CHILD_THINKING_LEVELS` | unset | Comma-separated thinking-level route by child depth. |
| `RLM_COST_FILE` | private temporary file | Append-only cost and token telemetry destination. |
| `RLM_EXTENSIONS` | `1` | Base extension policy propagated to children; it does not unload the wrapper's root extension. |
| `RLM_JSON` | `1` | Set to `0` for plain child output without structured cost parsing. |
| `RLM_MAX_CALLS` | `65536` | Emergency upper bound on admitted child calls in one tree; explicit smaller proof envelopes remain supported. |
| `RLM_MAX_CONCURRENT_CALLS` | `3` | Maximum active recursive child generations; excess calls wait without consuming the total-call allowance again. |
| `RLM_MAX_DEPTH` | `3` | Maximum recursion depth. |
| `RLM_MODEL` | active Pi model | Root route and inherited child model. |
| `RLM_PROVIDER` | active Pi provider | Root route and inherited child provider. |
| `RLM_REQUIRE_TRANSCRIPTS` | `0` | Set to `1` to require a private explicit session directory, stable-inode JSONL append proof, a durable receipt, and a post-cleanup lifecycle-terminal record for every admitted child. |
| `RLM_SESSION_DIR` | active Pi session directory | Directory for shared child sessions. |
| `RLM_SHARED_SESSIONS` | `1` | Set to `0` to prevent child session sharing. |
| `RLM_STDIN` | unset | Marker forcing an explicit stdin read, even when stdin appears interactive. |
| `RLM_SYSTEM_PROMPT` | repository prompt | Direct adapter prompt override; the wrapper pins this checkout's prompt. |
| `RLM_THINKING_LEVEL` | active Pi level | Root route and inherited child thinking level. |
| `RLM_TIMEOUT` | unset | Optional wall-clock seconds for the whole tree. |
| `RLM_TRACE_ID` | random | Sanitized tree identifier used in telemetry and session filenames. |
| `YPI_EXTENSION_DEBUG` | `0` | Set to `1` for extension diagnostics. |
| `YPI_NODE_BIN` | `node` | Node executable used by shell recursion, recovery, and native implementer launch adapters. |
| `YPI_PI_BIN` | repository dependency, then `PATH` | Explicit Pi executable override. |
| `YPI_PROMPT_INCLUDE_RUNTIME_SOURCE` | `0` | Root-only diagnostic opt-in that embeds the shell helper runtime source in the root prompt; it is never propagated to children. |
| `YPI_STALL_WARNING_SECONDS` | `600` | Idle seconds before an observe-only child warning. |
<!-- runtime-env:end -->

Provider credentials are forwarded through a separate explicit allowlist
checked against the pinned Pi source by `tests/test_provider_allowlist.sh`.

Useful telemetry readers:

```bash
./rlm_cost
./rlm_cost --json
./rlm_sessions --trace
```

`rlm_cost --json` includes input/cache/output/reasoning totals, peak context,
turns above 272,000 context tokens, and the ten highest-token generation-bound
child sessions. These values are observe-only and never change admission or
cancellation.

## Architecture

The runtime ownership boundary is:

```text
extensions/recursive.ts
  extensions/ypi/native-tool.ts
  extensions/ypi/runtime-core.ts
    extensions/ypi/internal/*

rlm_query
  dist/rlm_query.mjs
    extensions/ypi/cli.ts
    extensions/ypi/runtime-core.ts

rlm_cleanup
  scripts/cleanup-implementer-workspaces.ts
    extensions/ypi/internal/implementer-recovery/*
```

`scripts/build-runtime-cli --check` proves the generated CLI bundle matches
the TypeScript source. `docs/recursion-runtime-contract.md` defines adapter and
core ownership. Large proof-bound changes follow
`docs/bounded-recursive-development.md`.

## Verification

Fast deterministic gates:

```bash
make test-fast
make test-extensions
```

The fast suite includes type checking, generated-bundle parity, shell and
native contracts, guardrails, configuration drift, write confinement,
publication authority, transcript terminality, cross-depth cancellation, the
workspace lifecycle, and its crash matrices.

Provider-backed gates are explicit because they consume live model calls:

```bash
make test-recursion-e2e
make test-extensions-e2e
```

For a Pi upgrade, synchronize the repository dependency, `bun.lock`,
`.pi-version`, and the `pi-mono` tag before testing. The fail-closed identity
check prevents tests from certifying a stale source tree or PATH binary:

```bash
scripts/check-pi-version-alignment
scripts/check-upstream --dry-run
scripts/check-upstream
```

`check-upstream` never installs or replaces the host Pi. It tests the exact
repository binary; promote the host only after those gates and the configured
extension canaries pass.

Before pushing an owned feature branch:

```bash
make install-hooks
make pre-push-checks
scripts/validate-push-owner "$(git remote get-url --push origin)"
make land
```

`make land` requires a clean non-trunk branch, revalidates the exact commit,
and pushes only that branch to an owner-approved `origin`. It does not merge,
tag, publish, or create a release.

## Troubleshooting

Run `make doctor` first. It selects the same Pi executable as the wrapper and
shell adapter, detects an old or incompatible host binary, checks
`.pi-version`, and reports the ambient-extension decision. Recovery guidance
always points back to this source checkout:

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
make doctor
```

Set `YPI_PI_BIN` only when intentionally testing a different compatible Pi
executable. Historical changes are recorded in `CHANGELOG.md`.
