# Agent Instructions - ypi

## Authority Boundaries

- Use only the existing Git checkout. Never install or initialize Git or any
  other version-control system.
- Resolve push authority from the remote URL, never the remote name. A remote
  outside the exact `ruslanvasylev` owner namespace is read-only unless the
  current user request explicitly authorizes that exact operation.
- Never release, publish, or tag unless the current user request explicitly
  initiates that operation. Do not ask whether to do it.
- Never set or recommend a dollar budget for recursive work. Cost and token
  data are telemetry. Depth, total call admission, live progress, deduplication,
  and manual cancellation are controls.
- Preserve user changes in a dirty checkout. Do not reset or remove work you
  did not create.

## Runtime Model

This repository has one recursion engine:

- `extensions/ypi/runtime-core.ts` owns child admission, routing, resources,
  process execution, results, telemetry, and cleanup.
- `extensions/ypi/native-tool.ts` adapts that engine to Pi's native
  `rlm_query` tool.
- `extensions/ypi/cli.ts` adapts it to the `rlm_query` shell command.
- `extensions/ypi/internal/tree-coordinator.ts` owns root-generation
  authority, tree-wide call allocation, concurrency slots, launch
  registration, and terminal cancellation.
- `extensions/ypi/internal/implementer-lease.ts` owns the persisted writer
  lease contract shared by live execution and crash recovery.
- `extensions/ypi/internal/implementer-recovery/` owns stale-lease
  classification, verified salvage, and destructive workspace cleanup.
- `dist/rlm_query.mjs` is generated and must match the TypeScript source.

Every depth uses the same prompt, runtime, and extension. Review mode is
read-only by default. Writable delegation is root-only and limited to three
concurrent implementers with mechanically enforced, disjoint path scopes in an
existing clean Git checkout. Descendants cannot escalate writable authority.
Root cancellation marks the active coordinator generation terminal before it
signals registered child process groups. Detached survivors cannot admit or
launch new recursive work, and unrelated processes are never signal targets.

The root wrapper enables the shell helper and exposes concise source paths for
on-demand self-inspection. Runtime source is not embedded by default. A
root-only diagnostic opt-in may embed it temporarily, but that opt-in is never
propagated to children. Direct extension use exposes only the native tool.
Children load the canonical extension by default; ambient extension discovery
is an explicit compatibility choice.

## First Checks

For runtime failures, run:

```bash
make doctor
```

The most common failure is a stale or wrong host Pi binary. The doctor checks
the executable selected by the wrapper, its package identity, `.pi-version`,
and ambient-extension policy.

Before any change to `rlm_query`, its generated bundle, or the shared runtime:

```bash
make test-unit
```

After each coherent runtime change:

```bash
make test-fast
make test-extensions
```

After changing recursive behavior, run the live smoke:

```bash
echo "2+2=" | ./rlm_query "What is the answer? Reply with only the number."
```

The expected answer is `4`. A failure means the active recursive dependency is
broken and must be repaired before further feature work.

## Delegation

Use `rlm_query` only for a clear, bounded task that benefits from a fresh
context window. Read small inputs directly. At deeper levels, prefer returning
a concrete result over adding another child.

Native `mode=review` is the default. It is appropriate for audits, research,
and counterevidence. Native `mode=implement` is allowed only from the root for
bounded edit/write units with explicit scope and verification. Derive slices
from deterministic file discovery before issuing parallel calls. Never admit
overlapping scopes, mutate the real checkout while implementers are live, or
integrate one result before the full batch returns. The parent owns commands,
tests, final diff review, integration, and acceptance.

Each implementer edits its own detached ephemeral Git worktree. On success, the
runtime records the complete attempt at a verified `refs/ypi/attempt-*`
reference, removes the worktree, and reports the declared scope, reference,
commit, changed paths, diffstat, and removal verdict. The real checkout remains
clean until the root inspects and explicitly applies the refs. Applying
disjoint refs must be order-independent; surface any conflict as a confinement
defect. On unproven snapshot or removal state, the isolated worktree and lease
are retained for `rlm_cleanup` recovery.

Implementer worktrees contain tracked files only. Pass ignored-file or
uninitialized-submodule context explicitly, or keep the task in the root.

Shell `rlm_query --async` is for bounded read-only fan-out. It prints job,
output, sentinel, and PID data. There is no automatic repository completion
watcher; the caller owns collection and cancellation.

For large, proof-bound, or self-hosting changes, read
`docs/bounded-recursive-development.md` before the first child call. Use its
single persisted envelope, disjoint reviewers, one root integration head,
continuation-without-reset rule, and freeze-before-live-model gate.

## Git Workflow

Work on a reviewable feature branch:

```bash
git status --short --branch
git switch -c feat/description
# edit and validate
git add <scoped-paths>
git commit -m "type: description"
scripts/validate-push-owner "$(git remote get-url --push origin)"
git push -u origin HEAD
```

Before pushing:

```bash
make pre-push-checks
```

`make land` performs the same checks against an unchanged clean commit and
pushes only the current feature branch to an approved `origin`. It never
merges or creates any release artifact.

Install local hooks once per clone:

```bash
make install-hooks
```

## Project Layout

Do not add a second engine or duplicate configuration table. Runtime variables
belong in `config/runtime-env.json`; public descriptions belong in `README.md`.
`tests/test_config_surface.sh` enforces source, registry, and documentation
agreement.

## Test Gates

`make test-fast` runs without live model calls. It includes:

- TypeScript type checking and generated-bundle parity
- shell, native, and shared-runtime behavior
- depth, timeout, call-count, session, and isolation guardrails
- root-death and cross-depth cancellation terminality
- configuration and provider-credential allowlist completeness
- implementer admission, path-scope confinement, worktree/ref finalization,
  apply-order invariance, direct recovery-module coverage, and
  single/concurrent crash recovery
- publication authority and doctor behavior

`make test-extensions` loads the real pinned Pi without a model call.

Live calls are explicit:

```bash
make test-recursion-e2e
make test-extensions-e2e
```

Do not block the main conversation with an unattended long-running test. When
the surrounding runtime provides a completion signal, use it. Otherwise keep
the command attached or return a clear running-state handoff with its output
location and PID.

## Editing The Live Runtime

`rlm_query` and the TypeScript runtime are dependencies of the active agent.
Change one ownership layer at a time:

1. Run `make test-unit`.
2. Copy the file being changed to a local backup when rollback would otherwise
   be difficult.
3. Edit the source.
4. Run `make test-fast`.
5. Run the real `2+2` recursive smoke.
6. Remove the backup only after the active path is proven.

Do not change `rlm_query` and `SYSTEM_PROMPT.md` in one unverified step.

## Regression History

These failures have dedicated coverage and must not return.

### 1. Empty Pipe Mistaken For Context

Some CI shells make `/dev/stdin` appear to be a pipe even when it yields no
bytes. Use `RLM_STDIN` as the explicit-read marker; when a pipe read is empty,
fall back to inherited `CONTEXT`. Covered by T2-T4.

### 2. Prompt Text Passed As A Shell Argument

Large prompt text and shell escaping made argument passing unsafe. Pass the
prompt file path and let Pi read it. Covered by T8-T9.

### 3. Recursing On Tiny Context

Aggressive guidance created unnecessary child chains. Inspect context size and
read small inputs directly. Covered by E1 and E7.

### 4. Call Limit Off By One

Call allocation is one-based. Permit calls 1 through `RLM_MAX_CALLS` and reject
only the next allocation. Covered by native and guardrail suites.

### 5. Unsafe Trace Identifiers

`RLM_TRACE_ID` enters filenames. Sanitize it before any path use. Covered by
N13 and G52.

### 6. Timeout Anchored At Session Start

`RLM_START_TIME` belongs to each depth-0 recursion tree, not extension load.
Long-lived root sessions must receive a fresh tree anchor. Covered by N3, N12,
G4, and G16.

### 7. Invalid Background Notification Data

Child output must be JSON-encoded before it enters a notification record, and
temporary job paths must honor `TMPDIR`. Covered by G53.

### 8. Credential Allowlist Drift

The child environment is allowlisted. Completeness must be derived from Pi's
real provider credential source, not guessed suffix patterns. This specifically
caught `COPILOT_GITHUB_TOKEN` and `HF_TOKEN`. Covered by
`tests/test_provider_allowlist.sh`.

### 9. Root Death Left Detached Descendants Authoritative

Immediate-child process-group cleanup did not cover an independently detached
writer descendant. Bind admission and the final launch gate to one stable root
identity and terminal generation, then signal only registered groups. Covered
by `tests/cross_depth_cancellation_harness.ts`.

### 10. Coordinator Startup Outlived Its Private Directory

Synchronous environment setup can return before the Unix socket listen callback.
If a nonrecursive caller then retires its private state, startup must terminalize
and reject without an unhandled exception. Covered by
`tests/n84_telemetry_append_harness.ts`.

### 11. Continuation Could Not Adopt Its Call Counter

A fresh root process has no in-memory counter identity. It may adopt only an
exact private counter whose canonical contents match `RLM_CALL_COUNT`; mismatch
or replacement remains a hard failure. Covered by the concurrency harness.

### 12. Evidence Paths Exceeded Unix Socket Limits

The persisted proof directory may be longer than a Unix-domain socket path.
Use a bounded private socket directory when needed, close every coordinator
connection explicitly, and retire that directory only after server close.
Covered by the concurrency harness.

### 13. Root Transcript Hardening Blocked The Turn Lifecycle

An ancestor path alias made root transcript hardening throw before prompt
patching and root-generation rotation. Canonicalize benign ancestor aliases,
keep final-component identity checks fail-closed, and contain telemetry
hardening failures so route refresh and recursive lifecycle work continue.
Expose the degraded analytics state through a deduplicated warning and status.
Covered by the root-session privacy and failure-isolation harnesses.
