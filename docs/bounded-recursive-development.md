# Bounded Recursive Development

Use this runbook for large, proof-bound, or self-hosting ypi changes. It keeps
recursive review useful without turning the root session into an unbounded
orchestration tree.

This is an operating contract over existing ypi, repository, test, telemetry,
and eval surfaces. It does not introduce another orchestrator or VCS.

## Scope and non-goals

The root agent owns the goal, decomposition, parent-side adjudication, and final
diff acceptance. Read-only children own reviews and focused probes. One bounded
implementation unit may be delegated with `rlm_query` `mode=implement` after its
scope and gates are explicit; never run parallel implementers or distribute
overlapping runtime edits. Do not add a new result validator or make OpenProse
the proof owner. `.prose/recursive-development.prose` remains a lightweight
feature workflow and is not the proof-bound path described here.

## Create the envelope once

Initialize the run exactly once. The persisted envelope contains only non-secret
control and telemetry values; never write the full process environment to disk.
Cost is observational telemetry and never an admission or stop condition. Time
checkpoints surface elapsed work but never terminate a child.

set -euo pipefail
umask 077

```

At natural checkpoints, report elapsed time when
`now - YPI_RUN_STARTED_EPOCH >= YPI_RUN_CHECKPOINT_SECONDS`; this is advisory
only. A call-cap hit stops new child admission, not the task: continue directly
in the root, preserve completed evidence, and report the topology change without
asking the user to choose a new cap.

## Resume without resetting

A continuation brief must carry the exact `RUN_DIR`, HEAD, elapsed-time
checkpoint, open blockers, and next action. It must not carry credentials. A continuation sources
the existing envelope and requires all ledgers to exist; it never regenerates a
run ID or truncates a file.

```bash
set -euo pipefail
umask 077

RUN_DIR="<exact run directory from the continuation brief>"
test -f "$RUN_DIR/envelope.sh"
# shellcheck disable=SC1090
. "$RUN_DIR/envelope.sh"

test "$YPI_RECURSIVE_RUN_DIR" = "$RUN_DIR"
test "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)" = "$YPI_RUN_REPO_ROOT"
test "$(git branch --show-current)" = "$YPI_RUN_BRANCH"
test "$(git remote get-url --push origin 2>/dev/null || printf '<none>')" = "$YPI_RUN_ORIGIN_PUSH_URL"
git merge-base --is-ancestor "$YPI_RUN_BASE_HEAD" HEAD
test -f "$RLM_CALL_COUNTER_FILE"
test -f "$RLM_COST_FILE"
test -f "$PI_TRACE_FILE"

export RLM_CALL_COUNT="$(tr -d '[:space:]' < "$RLM_CALL_COUNTER_FILE")"
```

The repository root, feature branch, origin push URL, and ancestral base commit
bind the envelope to one delivery line while allowing later commits on that same
line. A rebase or remote change requires a fresh run instead of silently moving
proof state. The counter file is authoritative. Explicitly restoring
`RLM_CALL_COUNT` prevents a missing or contaminated ambient value from becoming
the fallback. The cost ledger preserves observational spend and token telemetry
across sessions.

## Call allocation

The 18-call ceiling is allocated as follows:

- three independent reviewers with at most two sequential probes each: 9;
- one focused re-review with at most one probe: 2;
- one independent closeout with at most one probe: 2;
- disagreement, failed-admission, or countercheck reserve: 5.

At most three top-level reviewers run concurrently. A reviewer may have only one
probe in flight. This bounds redundant fan-out while retaining the three distinct risk
viewpoints. Parent adjudication is direct root work and
never consumes a child-call slot.

## Execution order

1. **Discover deterministically.** Use `rg`, Python, source inspection, and
   existing validators before asking a model.
2. **Choose one implementation head.** Explore and decide in the root. Once a
   bounded unit has explicit files, constraints, and tests, delegate it to one
   `mode=implement` child or implement it directly when writing the charter
   would cost as much as the edit. The root reviews changed scope and the final
   diff and runs focused gates; it does not absorb a worker's trial-and-error.
3. **Run three independent reviews in one turn.** Do not expose sibling reports:
   - runtime/lifecycle: deadlines, cancellation, process groups, output,
     async, and jj cleanup;
   - packaging/evidence: routing, prompt authority, installed resolution,
     fallbacks, eval honesty, and release gates;
   - security/cleanup: path containment, permissions, temp ownership,
     symlinks, deletion scope, and hostile metadata.
4. **Absorb skeptically.** The parent deduplicates by mechanism, reproduces each
   accepted finding, and records it in the existing blocker/telemetry ledger.
5. **Fix serially.** Re-evaluate only invalidated owners.
6. **Run one focused re-review.** Give it open blockers and changed paths; ask
   only for resolution failures and regressions. Add another reviewer only for
   a named disagreement the parent cannot resolve.
7. **Run one independent closeout.** Stop the review loop after PASS unless a
   direct counterexample invalidates it.

If a second broad `REOPEN` occurs or root context degrades, write a continuation
brief and resume with the same envelope before making more edits.

## Child result boundary

Each reviewer returns at most 12 KiB and up to eight highest-severity findings
inline. Every inline finding includes `path:line`, mechanism, user impact, and
one reproduction command or artifact reference. If more findings exist, the
child writes the complete report beneath the run directory and returns its path
plus `additional_finding_count`; findings are never silently discarded.

Long reproduction scripts belong in run artifacts, not the parent response. No
new schema validator is required; this is a charter and parent-absorption rule.

## Model and async policy

Reviewers, focused re-review, and closeout use the strong configured model.
Mechanical discovery stays in deterministic tools. A cheaper model is allowed
only for a bounded synthesis call launched in its own shell process with an
explicit provider/model route; do not set global depth routing.

Native calls are sequential so a shared-checkout implementer cannot overlap
root mutations. Parallel evidence uses at most three shell `rlm_query --async`
read-only jobs and only after a notification smoke proves that this Pi instance
receives its sentinel and useful root work is queued. If the smoke fails or
`YPI_INSTANCE_ID` is absent, stay sequential rather than debugging a replacement
during the run.

## Freeze before provider-backed evaluation

Before the first live-model lane:

1. close all source-review blockers;
2. run focused tests, package/install checks, and release consistency;
3. run `scripts/encrypt-prose --check`;
4. run `make test-eval-contracts` with mock Pi;
5. commit every tracked change;
6. require a clean worktree and record exact HEAD.

Runtime parity runs only through the existing facade:

```bash
YPI_EVAL_OUTPUT_ROOT="$RUN_DIR/eval" make eval-runtime-parity LANE=canonical-cli
YPI_EVAL_OUTPUT_ROOT="$RUN_DIR/eval" make eval-runtime-parity LANE=legacy-cli
YPI_EVAL_OUTPUT_ROOT="$RUN_DIR/eval" make eval-runtime-parity LANE=canonical-native
YPI_EVAL_OUTPUT_ROOT="$RUN_DIR/eval" make eval-runtime-parity LANE=legacy-native
```

`tests/eval/runtime-parity/run-lane.sh` owns recursion-environment sanitization,
private counters/ledgers, exact transition and call-count proof, and semantic
scoring. Do not construct an ad-hoc `env -i` lane. Do not edit tracked files
while lanes run. A tracked edit invalidates final runtime evidence. Permit one
rerun only for a documented provider/transient failure.

## Closeout and delivery

Completion requires resolved telemetry, deterministic and installed-package
checks, exact-final-commit runtime contracts, parent verification, truth-seeking
review, telemetry validation, encryption validation, and honest branch state.
Import a recursive trace into Agent Protocol only when child execution itself is
being promoted as proof.

Before any push, resolve the push URL and run `scripts/validate-push-owner`.
Remotes whose exact owner namespace is not `ruslanvasylev` are read-only unless
the current user request explicitly authorizes that exact target. Release,
tagging, and package publication are separate user-initiated tasks and are never
inferred or suggested by this delivery workflow.

## Metrics

Record allocations, spawned sessions, overlapping child-minutes, root wall
time, transcript bytes, cost/tokens from the run ledger, duplicate mechanisms,
timeouts, and rejected live-model lanes. The historical non-dollar baseline is 131
allocations, 42 sessions, 842.6 overlapping child-minutes, 31.4 MB transcripts,
and about 9h20m root wall time. The historical orchestration had no comparable
`RLM_COST_FILE`; do not invent a dollar baseline or savings percentage.
